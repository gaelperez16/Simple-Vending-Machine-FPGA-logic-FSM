# VHDL Vending Machine FSM

This project implements a **finite state machine (FSM)** for a digital vending machine using **VHDL**. The vending machine accepts coins—nickels (5¢), dimes (10¢), and quarters (25¢)—and processes purchases once at least 20¢ has been inserted. If 25¢ is inserted, the system returns 5¢ as change.

## Features

- Written in **VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)
- FSM with 7 defined states based on accumulated coin value
- Accepts multiple coin inputs:
  - `00`: No coin
  - `01`: Quarter (25¢)
  - `10`: Nickel (5¢)
  - `11`: Dime (10¢)
- Activates a **purchase signal (A)** at ≥ 20¢
- Returns **change (C)** when applicable
- **Reset functionality** to clear state
- Fully simulated using **Intel Quartus Prime** and the **University Waveform tool**

## FSM Design Summary

The state machine is designed around these core ideas:

- **States** represent total inserted value (`S0`, `S5`, `S10`, ..., `S30`)
- **Transitions** depend on binary-encoded coin input (`inputOne`, `inputTwo`)
- **Output Conditions**:
  - `A = '1'` → Purchase valid (≥ 20¢)
  - `C = '1'` → Change due (when more than 20¢ is inserted)
- The machine **resets to `S0`** after a valid transaction or when `R = '1'`
